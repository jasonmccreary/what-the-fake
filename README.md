# What the fake?
This repo contains a Laravel 10 application used to demostrate testing with fakes during my Laracon US 2023 talk.

You may review the [individual commits](https://github.com/jasonmccreary/what-the-fake/commits/main) to isolate some of the changes, or, of course, clone this repo to run the tests locally.

Don't hesitate to [reach out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gonedark) with any feedback or questions.
